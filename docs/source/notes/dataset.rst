Dataset
=======

The AirfRANS dataset makes available numerical resolutions of the incompressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations over the NACA 4 and 5 digits series of airfoils and in a subsonic flight regime setup.

Its features are:

- 1000 simulations
- Reynolds number between 2 and 6 million
- Angle of attacks between -5째 and 15째
- Airfoil drawn in the NACA 4 and 5 digit series
- Four machine learning tasks representing different challenges.
	
The four tasks are defined as followed:

- **Full data regime**: 800 simulations are used for the training and 200 are kept for testing. Both the trainset and the testset are drawn from the same distribution. This defines an interpolation task.
- **Scarce data regime**: Same testset as the `Full data regime` task but with only 200 simulations in the trainset. This also defines an interpolation task but in a low data regime scenario.
- **Reynolds extrapolation regime**: Simulations with Reynolds number between 3 and 5 million are kept for the trainset, the others are kept for the testset. This defines an extrapolation task for the reynolds number parameter.
- **Angle of attack extrapolation regime**: Simulations with angle of attack between -2.5째 and 12.5째 are kept for the trainset, the others are kept for the testset. This defines an extrapolation task for the angle of attack parameter.
	
Downloading the dataset
-----------------------
	
You can download the dataset by using the function :obj:`airfrans.dataset.download`

.. code-block:: python

	import airfrans as af
	
	af.dataset.download(root = PATH_TO_SAVING_DIRECTORY, file_name = 'Dataset', unzip = True, OpenFOAM = False)

for the pre-processed dataset where simulations have been cropped, minimum features have been kept and ``.vtu`` / ``.vtp`` files have been generated. For the raw OpenFOAM dataset, simply set ``True`` to the ``OpenFOAM`` argument. You can also directly download it `here <https://data.isir.upmc.fr/extrality/NeurIPS_2022/Dataset.zip>`_ for the pre-processed version and `there <https://data.isir.upmc.fr/extrality/NeurIPS_2022/OF_dataset.zip>`_ for the raw OpenFOAM.

Finally, you can access to a ready-to-use version via `PyTorch Geometric datasets <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html#torch_geometric.datasets.AirfRANS>`_.

Loading the dataset
-------------------

After dowloading the pre-processed dataset, you can load the list of simulations in NumPy arrays with the function :obj:`airfrans.dataset.load`

.. code-block:: python

	dataset_list, dataset_name = af.dataset.load(root = PATH_TO_DATASET, task = 'full', train = True)

We recommend to handle this data with a Geometric Deep Learning library such as `PyTorch Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ or `Deep Graph Library <https://www.dgl.ai/>`_.

.. note::

	The dataset loaded when using :obj:`airfrans.dataset.load` contains point clouds defined as the nodes of the simulation mesh. Do not hesitate to build a custom dataset if you want to use volume/surface sampling of simulations instead of the nodes of the mesh via the :class:`airfrans.Simulation`. The only constraint is that the test scores of models for the four target fields have to be computed at the position of the nodes of the simulation meshes.

Raw versus pre-processed dataset
--------------------------------

The raw dataset contains the simulations of the AirfRANS dataset as they were outputed by OpenFOAM. The pre-processed version differs from the raw version as it only includes a processed version of the ``.vtu`` / ``.vtp`` files of the simulations.

For the internal field given in the file ending by ``internal.vtu``, we followed:

- **Clipping**: Clip to a box of size ``[(-2, 4), (-1.5, 1.5), (0, 1)]`` where each tuple represents an axis in the order x, y, and z. We did it with the PyVista `clip filter  <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.DataSetFilters.clip_box.html>`_ and we set ``crinkle = True`` in the parameters to leave the cells untouched.
- **Slicing**:  Take a slice at :math:`z = 0.5` to go from a 3D mesh to a 2D mesh. We did it with the PyVista `slice filter <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.DataSetFilters.slice.html>`_ and we set ``generate_triangles = False``.
- **Distance function**: Compute the distance function with the PyVista `compute_implicit_distance filter <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.DataSetFilters.compute_implicit_distance.html>`_.
- **Keep only the required fields**: Only keep the pressure, the velocity, the turbulent viscosity, and the distance function in the data.

For the aerofoil patch (internal boundary) given in the file ending by ``aerofoil.vtp``, we followed:

- **Normals**: Compute the normals with the PyVista `compute_normals filter <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.PolyDataFilters.compute_normals.html>`_. We set ``flip_normals = False`` leading to inward-pointing normals.
- **Slicing**: Take a slice at :math:`z = 0.5` to go from a 2D mesh to a 1D mesh. We did it with the PyVista `slice filter <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.DataSetFilters.slice.html>`_ and we set ``generate_triangles = False``.
- **Keep only the required fields**: Only keep the pressure, the velocity, the turbulent velocity, and the normals in the data.

For the freestream patch (external boundary) given in the file ending by ``freestream.vtp``, we followed:
- **Slicing**: Take a slice at :math:`z = 0.5` to go from a 2D mesh to a 1D mesh. We did it with the PyVista `slice filter <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/api/core/_autosummary/pyvista.DataSetFilters.slice.html>`_ and we set ``generate_triangles = False``.
- **Keep only the required fields**: Only keep the pressure, the velocity, and the turbulent velocity in the data.
